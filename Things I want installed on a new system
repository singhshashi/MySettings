This is a list of things that I am currently using on my system which was not installed by default and I want to install on a new system:

1. tldr.sh (better man pages) 
2. Coding font with Ligatures. FiraCode


I may eventually start using a customised version of vim so I will record here the customizations that I do for vim, if any, in the future.
